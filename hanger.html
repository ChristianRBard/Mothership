    <!-- HANGER DESCRIPTION -->

        <p class="text-box text-desc">
            This is the "<strong><u>Hanger,</u></strong>" or my archive of old creative work / things that defined the past me. Although 
            some of these things I can't help but to be embarassed about, I wanted to create a safe space where looking into the past can 
            be fun... and less focused on the "cringe" nature of it.

                Planet Minecraft was a site I frequently visited and contributed to 10 years ago now - in 2015. I used it as a way to express myself, where I created Minecraft 
                skins because it was fun and I saw my art improving. I was in my own little world and thought it was special to have "100 followers!" Going back and 
                reading some of the skin descriptions reminds me of how differnet internet culture was then. There was a constant in people wanting to either be different
                in any way they could or you could be caught in an overbearing fog of fake kindness. A part of me wishes it was still this way! A couple years ago I decided
                to take a crack at it again to see if I still had it, hince why the banner is "Haven't posted in 6 years but here's one for ol' times sake." I'm still surprisingly 
                happy with how the banner came out still considering I doodled, used a shape tool, and ran about 10 filters on it. Anyway, the link forwards to the page!
